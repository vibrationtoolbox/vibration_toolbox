% 02/28/00    vtb2_3          Can now take a list of values for zeta. 
% 02/04/00    vtb7			  Added references to vtb7_4 and vtb7_5
% 01/13/00    numerous        Removed GUI buttons for printing since
%                                  recent version of Matlab enable such 
%                                  GUI capabilities on all platforms.
%                                  Also, removed a number of figure 
%                                  commands. This will allow the user to 
%                                  invoke the hold command and plot 
%                                  multiple graphics on a single figure.
% 01/13/00    readme.txt      Updated version of toolbox to 5 to represent 
%             Contents.m           dropping of support for version 4 of 
%                                  Matlab in future releases.
% 11/08/99    vtb7_4          Improved robustness of curve fitting with
%                                  the addition of a few checks.
%                                  Note: This code does not fit 
%                                  simultaneous FRFs. Thus the results
%                                  for MDOF systems can vary.
% 10/07/99    vtb7_4          Added. Now FRF curve fitting can be 
%                                  performed to ID damping, natural
%                                  frequencies, and even mode shapes.
%                                  There is enough there to perform a 
%                                  complete modal analysis.
% 10/07/99    vtb7_5          Added. Now FRFs of computational models
%                                  can be obtained, viewed, or used in 
%                                  vtb7_4. Includes receptance, 
%                                  mobility, and inertance, along with 
%                                  output of the corresponding frequency 
%                                  vector.
% 11/20/98    readme.txt      Updated to clarify installation 
%                                  instructions
% 11/11/98    vtbud           Modified URL for web page to use shorter
%                                  (~) link.
% 11/11/98    vtb3_3          Modified example to match default
%                                  function (Example 3.3.1, T=1)
% 04/03/98    vtbud           Running vtbud automatically displays
%                                  the most recent vtb updates in
%                                  your web browser
% 04/03/98    vtb,vtoolbox    Added error response when called without 
%                                  help
% 03/30/98    Contents        Added reference to web page
% 03/30/98    Readme          Corrected reference to new web page
% 03/30/98    vtb             Added reference to web page
% 03/17/98    vtb4_2          Incorrect matrix exponential fixed
