The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for `MATLAB`_
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Engineering Vibration Toolbox can be installed by downloading 
`vtbudm`_ and executing it from within MATLAB. Executing it
later also installs or removes the toolbox. You will get an error if ``vtbud.m`` is not in your
path. If that happens, open ``vtbud.m`` in the MATLAB editor and press the F5 key. This will download
``vtoolbox.zip``, expand it in the desired location, and add the path to it to
your default MATLAB path. Alternatively, copy and
paste this into your MATLAB command console:


.. code-block:: matlab

   » urlwrite('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/master/vtbud.m','vtbud.m');vtbud

and press RETURN. 

The current revision status of the *Engineering Vibration Toolbox* for
Matlab can
be viewed in the `github
repository <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox>`_ or more
easily in the `vtbud.txt <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`_ file on this website.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of updates since 1/1/98
can be obtained for your current version by typing ``help vtbud`` in
MATLAB. That can be compared to the `most up-to-date release <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`__.

They will load/run on all platforms supported by MATLAB. The binary files are all ``.mat`` files, and the different extensions represent different parts of a project group. To load
them type:

.. code-block:: matlab
          
   » load filename -mat

where » is the MATLAB prompt. [#]_ The
filename must include the extension unless it is ``.mat``.

If you can't execute any of the ``.m`` files (try for
example typing "vtbud" from the MATLAB prompt), they
are either not in the MATLAB path, or did not get
transferred in the correct format (unlikely these days). Use the ``cd`` command (like DOS) from
within MATLAB to move to the ``vtoolbox`` directory. If
you can see the files using ``dir``, and still cannot execute them, then try
transferring the text files again, being sure that they are transferred in
ASCII (text) format.

Removing the Engineering Vibration Toolbox:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type ``vtbud`` from the MATLAB prompt. 


The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave
-------------------------------------------------------

Download the zip archive for the `Octave Engineering Vibration
Toolbox`_. Please read the :code:`Readme.rst` file inside the archive
or refer to it on the `Octave Engineering Vibration Toolbox distribution site`_.

Installation on a Windows machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunately I haven't had success recently. This should work, but
doesn't, and I haven't the time to track the problem down. If you get
it all working, please provide me feedback on how to get it to
work. In the mean time, my recommendation is to install VirtualBox_
and install Ubuntu_ (Linux_), then follow the `Linux Installation`_ instructions
above. 

#. Install Cygwin_ to start. Now don't go to fast. Part of the way
   through you will have the option of installing some packages. 
      
   #. Look in the math section. Select the main *Octave* distribution
      and anything else (all is perhaps easiest).

   #. Also select and
      install ``xinit``, ``xlaunch``, ``nedit`` and ``gnuplot``. I am taking
      this from `wiki.octave.org <http://wiki.octave.org>`_ (and other sources), so if it doesn't
      work, please look there. 

   #. Open the Cygwin terminal.

   #. Type ``xlaunch.exe`` and hit return. Answer the questions, open
      a single window, start a program, don't use Native OpenGL, launch the application
      ``nedit`` in place of the default ``xterm``.

   #. A window should come up. Open the file `.bash_profile` and
      append the following::
        
        PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/opt/gnome/bin:/opt/kde2/bin
        MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/X11R6/man:/opt/gnome/man:/opt/kde2/share/man
        INFOPATH='/usr/info;/usr/local/info;/opt/gnome/info'
        KDEDIR=/opt/kde2
        export PATH MANPATH INFOPATH KDEDIR

   #. Use ``nedit`` again to create a file ``.xinitrc`` in your home
      directory in Cygwin. The contents should be::

        exec /opt/gnome/bin/gnome-session

   #. Close Cygwin, relaunch it, and type ``startx``. This should
      start a desktop environment from which you shoul be able to run
      Octave_. 

#. Put the unzipped ovtoolbox folder in
   ``C:\Program Files\GNU Octave #\usr\share\octave\site\m`` where \#
   is the version number of your Octave installation.
#. Replace the file
   ``C:\Program Files\GNU Octave\#\usr\share\octave\site\m\startup``
   with the file ``startup`` in the ``ovtoolbox`` directory. This will make
   Octave behave more Matlab like and help assure greater
   compatibility. [#]_
#. Type ``help vtb1`` after running Octave to see if the installation of
   the Engineering Vibration Toolbox worked.
#. Create a directory
   ``C:\Program Files\GNU Octave #\usr\share\octave\site\m\myfiles``
   where you can put your script and program files.

.. _Linux Installation:
   
Installation on a Unix/Linux machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before the Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave can be installed,
Octave_ must be
installed. Please consult the Octave_ website for installation
instructions. Alternatively, most Linux_ distributions have it as an
easy installation via their package managers. Most pupular, if you are
installing Linux for the first time, is probably Ubuntu_. 

The toolbox can go in any directory as long as the Octave_ path is
set properly in the ``.octaverc`` file in the user's home directory. Like
any of the other toolboxes, you should not save personal files inside
the ``ovtoolbox`` directory since you may inadvertently lose them when you
update (i.e. you may decide to delete the directory and replace
everything).

Example: On my Mac (which is BSD unix), my ``.octaverc`` file contains the
command: ``path(path,"/User/jslater/MyMath/ovtoolbox");``



Printing plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To print a plot, the easiest way may be to type ``print`` from the Octave
console. This should bring up dialog boxes that enable you to send the
current plot to your current Windows printer.

The ``print`` command can also be used to generate graphics files for
embedding into your favorite word processing program. Type ``help print``
for details. By default the file will end up in the directory
``C:\Program Files\GNU Octave #\octave_files`` on Windows.



Acknowledgments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave has come from a number of
sources. First and foremost, Daniel J. Inman, who initially tasked
me and Donald J. Leo to write version 3.0 of the software for his text
"Engineering Vibration" by Dr. Daniel J. Inman (Prentice Hall, 1994). I
also thank the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and
the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State
University for providing the computer resources for developing the
MATLAB 4 version of the software. Perhaps the people who have given the
most are my students who painfully experienced every piece of beta code,
often at the least opportune times. Thanks is also given to Dr. Maurice
Petyt and Robert C. Chiroux for their patience in testing numerous 4.0
beta versions of this software. Finally, John W. Eaton and others for
writing/coordinating/developing/supporting Octave. Please see the
Octave_ website for more information on Octave and how you can
support its development.

Using the Engineering Vibration Toolbox
=====================================================

Typing ``help vtb?``, where ``?`` is a number, will provide a table of contents for the files
related to chapter '?'. Typing ``help codename`` will provide help on the
particular code. Note  that the ``filename`` is ``codename.m``.

Engineering Vibration Toolbox commands can be run by typing them with
the necessary arguments just as any other Octave/MATLAB
commands/functions. For instance, :code:`vtb1_1` can be run by typing
:code:`vtb1_1(1,.1,1,1,0,10)`. Many functions have multiple forms of input.
The help for each function shows this flexibility.


Faculty/Instructors/GTAs
=========================
Please send comments and questions regarding the Engineering Vibration
Toolbox by email to `Joseph C. Slater`_. Please use the `vtbud.m`_
function to check for updates (Type :code:`vtbud` at the matlab prompt).  

Donate/Payment
===============
The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for MATLAB (not the Octave version,
or any version that runs on a non-proprietary platform) is free only
to owners of Engineering Vibration, Daniel J. Inman. Please contact
`me`_ regarding usage for commercial purposes.
