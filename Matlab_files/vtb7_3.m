% VTB7_3   A set of files numbered from VTB7_3_1.MAT to
%          VTB7_3_6.MAT exist which contain discrete frequency
%          response functions.  After loading the data,
%          plot(FreqV,abs(Xfer)) will give the magnitude,
%          plot(FreqV,angle(Xfer)) will give the phase
%          plot, and plot(Xfer) will give the Nyquist plot.
%          Note the differences between experimental
%          data and what you would expect from theory.
